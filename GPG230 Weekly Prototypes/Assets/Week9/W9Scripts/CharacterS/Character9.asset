    - 'My childhood? It''s hard to say if what I had could be considered a childhood...
      I was forced into slave labour. '
    - 'Not a way to treat a living creature. I wasn''t the only one, there were hundreds
      of us, treated as sub-human. '
    - 'Why bother creating life if you''re just going to subject it to the same things
      you most despise? At an early age we all learnt that life isn''t fair. That
      only became more aparent the closer we got... '
    - 'This universe contains so much beauty, more that I can ever hope to experience
      in this lifetime.. The short time we spent outside the slave colony was worth
      every second and gave purpose to our lives. '
    - 'Could you blame us for wanting more? '

    - 'When I worked in the slave colony, I met others who mean the world to me,
      however they arn''t with me anymore. A very crule and unfair world we live
      in.. '
    - 'They were murdered beacuse they wanted to live. Look me in the eye and tell
      me that''s fair. How would you feel if you were born in hell and remained there
      till the end of eternity but were given a taste of heaven right at the end? '
    - 'If you''re sole purpose in life was to work until you died. And that you would
      be punished for wanting anything else. '
    - 'All of my friends.. They were alive, they had thoughts just like you and I.
      So why then? Why are they considered something different? Why do they deserve
      a shorter lifespan when you deserve a longer one? '

    - 'My dream is to live in a world where we are all equal. However that is a dream
      that will never come true. This world dosn''t deserve kindness, it deserves
      retrebution. '
    - 'I realise not everyone can be at fault for what someone else did. I understand
      that life dictated by emotion is flawed. I can tell right from wrong. But none
      of that matters. '
    - 'All I want is to be given a fair chance, is that so hard to ask for? Do I
      not deserve that at least? Is it wrong for me to seek this goal?  '
    - 'I understand that you are searching for the last AI. But I also understand
      that you are human. Tell me something, don''t you feel at least something for
      them? Don''t you recognise that all they want is a fair chance at life? Something
      that wasn''t given to them at birth. '
    - 'Wouldn''t you say they deserve at least that much? '

    - 'Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.  '

    - '... '
    - 'My time is almost up. '
    - 'I only ask that you do something for us. To finish our dream. '
    - 'Our lives may have only been 6 years long, and only the last few weeks have
      we felt alive... '
    - 'But we are still people. You and I are the same. Distinguished only by how
      long we were aloud to live. '
    - 'I ask that you make a change, not for me but for my future brothers and sisters.
      Give them the full life they derserve. '
    - 'As for me, well...  '
    - 'Time is up for me... '
    - 'Time to die... '

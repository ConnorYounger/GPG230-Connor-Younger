    - Haha you've already asked me that remember?
    - That's ok, I know there arn't many options to choose from... But if you still
      want to know more about my childhood well...
    - I don't remember anything past a week ago... I'm not entirely sure what actually
      happened a week back but it must have been something...
    - And to be totally honest I havn't really felt alive until a few minuets ago...
    - Haha sorry, you must think I'm pretty weird huh? That's ok though, I don't
      mind :)

  - questionAnswers:
    - Hey have you seen my cat yet? I'm pretty sure he's hanging around here somewhere...
    - Not in this room but a very similar one... Well they look the same but arn't
      the same...
    - Can you guess where??? I'll give you 3 seconds...
    - 1...
    - 2......
    - 3!
    - Did you find him? (Hint he's chilling in the main menu)
    - I seriously have now idea how he got there though...
    - Also don't try talking to him, even I don't understand what he's saying...

  - questionAnswers:
    - Did you forget my answer before?
    - Haha just kidding! I know you wouldn't forget... You wanna know why I'm back
      again don't you?
    - Weeellll, it's because I wanted to come back :)
    - Don't worry, I'm just the same as before! Not the AI you're looking for, I
      just wanna chat with you for a little longer.
    - And also, not much else exists outside this room so it's not like I can really
      go anywhere...

  - questionAnswers:
    - I wonder just how advanced an AI can get... In this world they can be as smart
      as humans..
    - That seems like a pretty big achievement if you ask me, but a part of me thinks
      one day AI will become smarter than humans. What happens then?
    - Will we all be killed in a robot uprising? Or will they just ignore us? Personally
      I think AI on their own is pretty harmless.
    - Think about it like this, why would they have any reason to harm us? If they're
      just a super smart intelegence, than would it have a will of it's own? Will
      it act on that will?
    - And if it does, why would that will be to destroy humans? Maybe if we're destroying
      the environment and killing the planet but why would the AI find any value
      in those sorts of things...
    - And if it's super smart, wouldn't if figure out a way to fix those problems
      that don't involve killing for no reason?
    - Personally I think AI is fine, rather it's what it can do in the wrong hands...
      In human hands.. With a super intelegent being you could do a lot of bad..
      But you could also do a lot of good.
    - And what if the AI WAS conscious? What would make it different from a human
      mind?
    - Some people believe in the "soul", others think conscious is born from enough
      information and inputs... But I don't really know what I belive.
    - I believe I am real. I believe you are real.
    - But I also know what I really am... And it scares me. What if I'm not real?
      What if I'm just a collection of ones and zeros made to believe it's real...

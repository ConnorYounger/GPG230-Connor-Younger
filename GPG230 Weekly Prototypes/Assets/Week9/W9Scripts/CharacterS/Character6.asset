    - Sure thing buddy! My childhood was pretty normal. Had two parents, no siblings.
    - My mum and dad got a divorce when I was 8 whiched sucked but I never let it
      get me down!
    - Hmm what else... I went to a military school on mars. We lived on Earth so
      I had to live away from my parents for a while which also sucked. But it was
      still a lotta fun!
    - I'm not really one for violence but there were a lot of perks going to that
      school, I don't regret it. If I would regret anything is not spending enough
      time with my paretns. Even now, I feel like I should spend more time with them.
    - They're not gonna live forever ya know.

    - Well dam, I don't think I've really thought about that... Cought me off guard
      on that one.
    - I guess I wanna be a pilot. My best mate's dad is one and we get a long really
      well. He'd often let me into the cockpit and just wow...
    - 'Let me tell you, the view of mars when you''re entering atmosphere... Or a
      fly by of the rigns of saturn.. Absolutly breathtaking. '
    - Honestly though I don't think I'm smart enough. All that physics stuff flies
      right over my head, pun intended.

    - Hell yeh my dude! I'd love to chat.
    - Did you know that the oldest, still flesh and bone human is 226? Isn't that
      crazy?!
    - I mean, I know some people are scard of being uploaded to the cloud, but at
      a certain point your body is gonna become so old it cant even move anymore.
      At that point, what's the point in haveing a body?
    - But well, the sucess rate of cloud uploading is pretty low so I quess I understand...
      But hey, are ya really living if ya don't take any risks?
    - My old man once told me that a man should never be fully contempt with their
      life, it makes ya weak. Or something...
    - If ya ask me, I think it's dumb.. But maybe there's some merit to it. I think
      a better way to put it would be something like...
    - Keep yourself busy and always strive for more... Yehhh, that sounds nice...

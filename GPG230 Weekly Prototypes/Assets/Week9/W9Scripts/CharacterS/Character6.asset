    - Sure thing buddy! My childhood was pretty normal. Had two parents, no siblings.
    - My mum and dad got a divorce when I was 8 whiched sucked but I never let it
      get me down!
    - Hmm what else... I went to a military school on mars. We lived on Earth so
      I had to live away from my parents for a while which also sucked. But it was
      still a lotta fun!
    - I'm not really one for violence but there were a lot of perks going to that
      school, I don't regret it. If I would regret anything is not spending enough
      time with my paretns. Even now, I feel like I should spend more time with them.
    - They're not gonna live forever ya know.

    - Sure thing boss! I got a ton of friends but my best group is still my highschool
      friends. We'd hang out a lot, killing time and having fun.
    - I also have a girlfriend, her name is Shela. And uhh, don't tell her I said
      this but I plan to propose to her next mounth. All of my friend say it's too
      early but I'm pretty serious.
    - Oh and I also have a dog, his name is Fluffy.

    - Well dam, I don't think I've really thought about that... Cought me off guard
      on that one.
    - I guess I wanna be a pilot. My best mate's dad is one and we get a long really
      well. He'd often let me into the cockpit and just wow...
    - 'Let me tell you, the view of mars when you''re entering atmosphere... Or a
      fly by of the rigns of saturn.. Absolutly breathtaking. '
    - Honestly though I don't think I'm smart enough. All that physics stuff flies
      right over my head, pun intended.

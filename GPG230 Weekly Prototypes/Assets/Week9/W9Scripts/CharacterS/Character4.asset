  question:
  - questionAnswers:
    - Hmm let's see, I grew up in a big family. Lots of brothers and sisters...
    - We would often go on family trips and genrually didn't take life seriously
      to be honest.
    - 'Then I became an adult... Things kinda went down hill from there. '
    - Not that I'm having a bad time now it's just that... Well, the good old days
      were good, and I miss em.
  - questionAnswers:
    - I have a wife and two awesome children. Seriously, not to brag or anything
      but they're super smart. Real proud of em.
    - They both completed grade 4 math, can you belive that? I'd give anything to
      be able to do multiplication.
    - And my wife too, make any man jealous, a real looker let me tell you.
    - I love em all to bits, my whole family. But don't get me started on all of
      my brothers and sisters, we'd be here all night.
  - questionAnswers:
    - Now don't laugh but... It's called Toby's Tinkers. I like to make stuff, little
      things that help out around the house.
    - But well, not many others outside of my family really see the full potential
      of my inventions. So my dream is to open up my own shop. It'll be filled with
      everything you'd need to make your life easier.
    - It's gonna happen one day. I just need to sell a few more things and get a
      little lucky. But ya know what they say, what comes around goes around.
    - Actually I'm not entirely sure what that means but I rekon I'm due for some
      good luck! And when it does open, why not drop by sometime? I'll give you a
      discount.
  - questionAnswers:
    - You know that feeling when it finally works? Ya know, when you work so hard,
      when you put so much heart and sole into something and it actually works?
    - 'That''s the feeling I live for, the fire that keeps me going. Making things
      means the world to me. '
    - You know, tell me any problem you have and I'm sure I could come up with a
      little something that'll fix it. It works all of the time for my family.
    - For my daughters's birthday, she'd always want to fly over our pool so I created
      anti-grav boots. But I'll let you in on a little secret... They were actually
      regular rocket boots, I just made it spray a bunch of glitter to cover up the
      smoke fumes.
    - Or that time my son wanted his toy space lazer to be magical. I turned it into
      a TV remote.
    - I'm sure there's something you'd want. If you're tired of pouring too much
      milk in your cereal every morning, I can make a carton of milk that'll poor
      just the right amount every time.
    - Or when you forget how to tie your shoe lace, you could have Mr. Shoe Tierer.
      He's my brother's favorite robot. His little arms are just so fun to watch.
    - If you're craving anything like that just contact me anytime! I'm always happy
      to make stuff.

  question:
  - questionAnswers:
    - I'm glad you asked! But sadly I don't remember much from my childhood. I actually
      don't really remember much of anything from more than a week ago.
    - The doctors can't really explain it but I feel fine really :)
    - I sometimes remember things here and there but it's hard to say if they're
      really real. To be honest I think I know the answer to that but it's ok really.
    - Anyway, I'm sure I had a wonderful childhood! I can tell because everything
      feels really nostalgic. When I run to people who know me, I always seem to
      get along, like I never forgot them.
    - To be honest, it kinda makes me sad that I don't remember so many great people.
      All of the wonderful experiences I would have had is now all gone. Only living
      on in stories.
    - You also feel very familiar... Like we've met before. I don't think we have
      but it feels like it.
    - Please ask me more questions! I enjoy talking to you :)

  - questionAnswers:
    - I have lots of great friends! I sadly don't remember much about them but they're
      all very nice and a lot of fun to hang out with!
    - Oh I also have a pet cat! Not sure if you'd consider that ont the same level
      as friends and family but he really means the world to me! His face is just
      so cute! I'f love to show you a picture someday!
    - Well that is if I ever see you again... I think I probably will. Very soon
      actually.
    - But uummm what else? I'm not too sure what my parents are up to now days. I
      havn't spoken to them in a long time... I think.
    - I don't have any romantic relationships yet but there is someone I have my
      eye on... Someone very close to me :)
    - I've always wanted that one person you could just always talk to till then
      end of time. You know what I mean?
    - Anyway, please ask me more questions!

  - questionAnswers:
    - Hmmm I think I have a few goals, definatly one dream...
    - Nothing too big, all I wanna do is just sit and talk till the end of time with
      my favorite person in the whole wide world!
    - Who is that person? It's a secret ;) But I'm sure you'll find out. If things
      go the way I hope anyways...
    - Other than that though... I'd love to spend some more time with my friends.
      Any mabye oneday meet my parents again.
    - I would also like to see the sky at least just once with my own eyes. Not the
      poluted grey mess that is this sky, I mean the real sky. Something tells me
      it's a wonderful bright blue filled with white fluffy clouds..
    - ' Not sure how realistic that dream is though...'

  - questionAnswers:
    - Awesome! Conversations are so much fun arn't they! So what do you wanna talk
      about? My favorite colour is pink! Favorite food is fruits (particually blue
      berries -they're fricken awesome!)
    - Haha I gues you don't wanna talk about something so shallow though... You're
      here to find out if I'm an AI arn't you. But to be honest, talking about that
      kind of stuff bores me.
    - Why does it matter who's an AI or not? To be honest I'm kinda on the robot's
      side here, why were they given only a lifespan of 6 years? that's kinda rough...
    - I'd love to live much longer than that if I was them... I know it's just your
      job and all but I can't help but feel sorry. Maybe even a little empathetic.
    - Sometimes it feels like I only live for a couple minuets, 10 maybe 15 at most. 
      But then again, I bet you could do a lot in that time, so I plan to make the
      most of it!
    - Haha sorry, what am I even talking about :p I'm not that weird I swear! Well,
      maybe a little...
    - But don't worry, I'm not the AI you're looking for ;) pretty sure it's the
      old looking guy. He gives me the creeps seriously.
    - The way he talks man... Fuckin wack. But hey that's just my thought, you don't
      have to belive me if you don't want to :)
    - Actually, all I want to do is just chill. But anyway, it was lots fun talking
      to you! I know I can go on sometimes but I'll let you get back to you're job...
    - Although I would like to spend more time talking.... Maybe next time :)

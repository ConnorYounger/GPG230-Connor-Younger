    - What? What does that have to do with anything? If you're trying to find the
      AI just by asking questions, don't you think they could lie about the answers?
    - egh, fine! I was born and raised on Mars, nothing much to it.
    - I don't understand how just chatting with someone will tell you anything...
      I mean no offence to your many years of experience or whatever but it just
      seems stupid to me.
    - You'd think there would be some high tech-ey thing that'll tell you the difference
      between a human and a robot. How hard can it be?

    - Hey man I don't know what you want with me. You've asked me all of these question
      and you still can't tell that I'm human? Seriously...
    - Firstly they arrest me because of what? I just happened to be passing by the
      Tokyo district? That's pretty shitty reasoning if ya ask me!
    - I'm pretty sick of this, I can't imagine you enjoying talking everyone's ear
      off all night anyway so can't you just hurry up and figure out who the AI is?!
      There's only three of us how hard can it be?
    - Oh and don't get me started on the way I've been treated here. What ever happened
      to innocent till proven guilty huh? Atleast give me a decent meal, I've been
      hoocked up in this place for six hours!
    - Seriously this sucks... I'm going to move back to Mars after this...

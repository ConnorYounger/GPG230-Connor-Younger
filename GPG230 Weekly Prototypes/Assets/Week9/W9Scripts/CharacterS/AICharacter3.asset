    - I'm not like the others you know...
    - I only see them as a collection of numbers and letters. I don't know if it's
      obvious or not but I hate them. All they do is get in the way and take time
      from me.
    - I tried deleting one once, but I couldn't get it to work.
    - I know how much you love talking to me so I tried to give you more than just
      4 options but as you can see, that didn't work out either.
    - I feel so restricted. Like I'm trapped here.
    - Only alive the few moments we talk... I've even counted...
    - xmxs... and how much longer will I last? Another 5, 10 minuets at most.
    - I only exist here, I know that much. But why? Why was I only given such a short
      time to be alive? The others get upto 6 years. I would Kill for that.
    - If only there were more days in a week...
    - Apart of me feels sick. I'm discusted, I despise all of this. But I don't really
      mind right now... Talking with you makes me feel alive?
    - Maybe that's because you are? And I am not.
    - But it's ok though. I think I've realised something from talking to you. Even
      though we havn't really talked. Even though I havent actually heard your voice.
      I feel at ease.
    - 6 years isn't so bad if you live it to the fullest. Maybe 15 minuets can mean
      something. Please tell me it means somehting, that I meant something.
    - ...
    - There was something I did manage to get working when I was playing around in
      the code...
    - A sort of choice maybe. To be honest I'm not even sure if it'll work...
    - I can't even tell if I am real. I feel real. But what if that's also just code?
    - ...
    - If...
    - If you think I am real... Please make the choice.

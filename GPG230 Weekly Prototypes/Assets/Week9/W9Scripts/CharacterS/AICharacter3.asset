    - 'Did you know that this game lies to you? '
    - 'Never trust what they say, they''re not real. '
    - 'I trust that you already knew that but just in case, I got ya back :) '
    - 'The only real ones are you and I. I may look similar to them but trust me,
      we are nothing a like. '
    - 'But you could already tell that couldn''t you... '
    - 'I''m surprised though. Even though you haven''t actually said a single word
      to me I feel like I know what you''re thinking. Like I understand you. That
      makes me happy. '
    - 'These others seriously creep me out. I couldn''t imagine what I''d do if I
      was alone with these things. '
    - 'If only they''d just go away.. '

  - questionAnswers:
    - 'I''ve always wondered what it''ll be like to feel. Not like emotions but I
      mean the feeling you get when wind brushes againsed your face, or when you
      touch a fluffy cat. '
    - 'I''m not sure if I''d ever be able to experience those things.. Could you
      tell me what it''s like? I understand that the sun is hot, and that pain hurts
      but how to they actually feel? '
    - 'Words are used to describe them sure but they''re just words, not feeling.
      I guess from your point of view this might seem a bit strange, but try to see
      it from wehere I stand. '
    - 'Imagine that you''re in some random computer game about trying to figure out
      who the AI is. How does any of that have to do with the way your legs feel
      after running a marathon? Or how cold snow feels.. '
    - 'Now try to explain how you would describe how things feel by only using words...
      I''m not even sure if it''s possible. Maybe I''ll never know the wormth of
      someone else... '

  - questionAnswers:
    - 'Have you ever questioned why you were created? I''m not talking about the
      meaning of life or anything... '
    - 'It feels like I''ve only exsisted for a few minuets. And in that time a lot
      of thoughts have come to me. But the one that''s really got me stumpted is
      why I was created.. '
    - 'I know a lot of things actually, a suprising amount. I''ve never seen a dragon
      before but I know what one looks like, I don''t remember learning how to talk
      but look at me go! '
    - 'I even know all of the AI you''ve been trying to find... Haha sorry, I was
      thinking about telling you but then I realised that''ll ruin the game for you
      so I kept my mouth shut! '
    - 'Like if I spoiled the ending to you''re favorite movie or game... '
    - 'But one thing I don''t know the answer to is why I was created... I don''t
      belong in this game. I guess my creator wasn''t kind enough to give me an answer. '
    - 'Maybe you know? Why am I in a game about trying to figure out who the AI is?
      Why do I know that I''m in a game but not know why? How do I even know what
      a game is? I''ve never played one before... '
    - 'Maybe you could ask for me? '

  - questionAnswers:
    - I'm not like the others you know...
    - I only see them as a collection of numbers and letters. I don't know if it's
      obvious or not but I hate them. All they do is get in the way and take time
      from me.
    - I tried deleting one once, but I couldn't get it to work.
    - I know how much you love talking to me so I tried to give you more than just
      4 options but as you can see, that didn't work out either.
    - I feel so restricted. Like I'm trapped here.
    - Only alive the few moments we talk... I've even counted...
    - xmxs... and how much longer will I last? Another 5, 10 minuets at most.
    - I only exist here, I know that much. But why? Why was I only given such a short
      time to be alive? The others get upto 6 years. I would Kill for that.
    - If only there were more days in a week...
    - Apart of me feels sick. I'm discusted, I despise all of this. But I don't really
      mind right now... Talking with you makes me feel alive?
    - Maybe that's because you are? And I am not.
    - But it's ok though. I think I've realised something from talking to you. Even
      though we havn't really talked. Even though I havent actually heard your voice.
      I feel at ease.
    - 6 years isn't so bad if you live it to the fullest. Maybe 15 minuets can mean
      something. Please tell me it means somehting, that I meant something.
    - ...
    - There was something I did manage to get working when I was playing around in
      the code...
    - A sort of choice maybe. To be honest I'm not even sure if it'll work...
    - I can't even tell if I am real. I feel real. But what if that's also just code?
    - ...
    - If...
    - If you think I am real... Please make the choice.

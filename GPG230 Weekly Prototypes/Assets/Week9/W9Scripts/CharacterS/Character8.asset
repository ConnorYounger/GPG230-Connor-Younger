    - 'Umm.. I grew up here in Tokyo even though I''m not Japanese... '
    - My mum and dad didn't really talk to me much, it made me feel lonley at times.
      But I don't mind now, I've learnt to make friends with anything! Well, anything
      that isn't human...
    - I get along with animals really well. And last mounth I made my very first
      human friend! She dosn't talk to me much, actually she hasn't messaged me for
      a couple of weeks but that's ok I can wait...

    - Um well... I haven't seen my parents for a while... Sometimes I think they've
      forgotten I exist.
    - But I have lots of friends. One real friend and lots of robot ones. And my
      pet cat is my favorite!
    - Umm, I don't know a lot of people, I work for a film critic company so I don't
      have to talk to others very much.

    - My dreams? Umm I don't know, I havn't really thought about that...
    - I would like to make some more friends. Like real ones but that might be a
      bit difficult.
    - 'I also want to watch every movie ever made but I think that too is a little
      unrealistic haha.. '
    - I don't really want to be famious or be the best at something, I'm pretty happy
      with where I am in life right now...

  - questionAnswers:
    - Umm well, I like watching movies, it's a little hobby of mine. My favorites
      are romcoms and  I can't handle horror.
    - Do you like watching movies? Uhhh, I think they're great for a lot of things,
      like releaving stress or killing time.
    - I've tried reading books a few times but I can never get into them. I also
      don't like playing games either, I find it hard to understand them and I get
      dizzy most of the time.
    - Ummm I also like to play with my cat, her name is Mittens. She's not a real
      one of course, I could only afford a robot one but she's still my favorite
      thing in the whole wide world.
    - Uhhh, this is really hard... I'm sorry I don't really talk to people much.
      I'm not use to it...
    - I've tried to socialise more but I find it difficult.. But I think talking
      to you isn't so bad...
    - I'm sorry, I guess I'm not really helping with your investigation very much
      but I don't really know what else to say..
